[](){ #deployment-kuberay }

[KubeRay](https://github.com/ray-project/kuberay) provides a Kubernetes-native way to run vLLM workloads on Ray clusters.
A Ray cluster can be declared in YAML, and the operator then handles pod scheduling, networking configuration, restarts, and rolling upgradesâ€”all while preserving the familiar Kubernetes experience.

## Why KubeRay instead of manual scripts?

| Feature | Manual scripts | KubeRay |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| Cluster bootstrap | Manually SSH into every node and run a script | One command to create or update the whole cluster: `kubectl apply -f cluster.yaml` |
| Fault-tolerance | Nodes must be restarted by hand | Pods are automatically rescheduled; head-node fail-over supported |
| Autoscaling | Unsupported | Native horizontal **and** vertical autoscaling via Ray Autoscaler & Kubernetes HPA |
| Upgrades | Tear down & re-create manually | Rolling updates handled by the operator |
| Monitoring | ad-hoc | Distributed observability with Ray Dashboard |
| Declarative config | Bash flags & environment variables | Git-ops-friendly YAML CRDs (RayCluster/RayService) |

Using KubeRay reduces the operational burden and simplifies integration of Ray + vLLM with existing Kubernetes workflows (CI/CD, secrets, storage classes, etc.).
